### Jack of all Trades, Master of none
I have spend the last couple of decades designing, building, guiding, supporting, and (often) lamenting infrastructure.  I started as a Network guy who could help glue things together, then moved on to helping solve Network problems for some of the biggest names around.  After that I moved in the wild world of OpenSource, where the problems I solve are bigger, the people are more fun, and the solutions are incredible.

### Reluctant Adventurer
Its not rare, but I don't get outside as much as I wish I could because I'm constantly drawn back to the screen for the interesting problems to be solved, but I do enjoy the outdoors.  Whether hiking, hunting, wandering, or just exploring there is just something about being the woods that lifts my spirits.

### Dogfather
I am a sucker for my animals.  Often its thanks to them that I get to go adventuring (like the one time my dog chased a Moose).  Couchtime, backyard time, and hiking time with them are among my favorite things.

### Builder
I love to build things.  Seriously.  All of them.
- Networks -> Check
- Code -> Check
- Home improvements -> Check
- Legos  -> Check
- Car projects -> Check
- Ikea furniture -> Absolutely Not

Okay, maybe not all of them, but most of them.  There is a significant sense of satisfaction when you can look back and say 'I built this thing'.  Even more satisfaction whe you can add 'and it works' to the end of that sentence.  I make no clames of my proficience, just my enjoyment. :-)
