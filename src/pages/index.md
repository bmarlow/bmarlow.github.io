    This is place for talking about interesting things.  While mostly technically skewed, the content here is a mix of solving problems, building things, and occasionally going outside.

        I spent much of my career as a Network Ninja (TM).  While I now spend less time
        these days complaining about RIBs, FIBs, reconvergence and VTP, Networking is 
        still near and dear to my heart.  I am still connected with much of the Networking
        world, so content here may cover some of this.

        These days I'm a Red Hatter.  I'm helping customers design and execute using
        the coolest software and people in Enterprise Open Source.  Most of the content
        here will reflect this.

        Am I the world's greatest Python programmer around.  Absolutely not.  That being said
        I like solving problems, and Python can make that easy.  Whether it be for systems, networks,
        or just some hackery to find out when my coffee maker will be back in stock on the manufacturer's
        website, Python helps me get things done, and that is awesome.

        Integrating products/projects/workflows is what makes the world go 'round.  While I am not a developer
        at heart, I am a guy who likes to build things and connect them (ask me about the Amazon Prime button, that I hooked up to AWS Lambda functions for fun).
